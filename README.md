# Minecrush 2

Welcome to Minecrush 2. The game where you hunt down your quota of gems before the time runs out. Read on to learn more about eh game and most importantly, how to play!

## About the game

In this game, you are a mining robot for the Yet Unnamed Company (or YUC for short). Your job is to collect precious gems from the TBD mine to fuel the shareholders relentless quest for profits. But you're a robot. You don't care about profit right? More importantly, you can't sue for death or injury in the workplace. It's just not in your programming. What is in there however, is how to collect gems. Need a reminder? Well here's how.

## How to play

To begin, click on the 'Start Game' button to deactivate the safety protocols and start rummaging for gems. You can't sue, but you still cost money. Anyways once you have begun, you will have 60 seconds to collect your set quota of gems before the mine collapses around you. Gems will appear every 3 seconds, and you will have to navigate to where they have fallen in order to grab them.

But how does one 'navigate'? Well by clicking the arrows handily placed at the bottom of your display of course. Up takes you up. Down brings you down. Right is right and, well, left is left. I mean what else would it be? You have also been equipped with a speaker for playing the finest of productivity music, hand picked by our productivity analysts. (NOTE: This feature is a work in progress, and currently doesn't work.)

And that's it. That's the game. Enjoy.
