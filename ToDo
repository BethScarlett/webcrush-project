//////Game Project//////

Name - Webcrush
Type - Topdown exploration
Brief description - The player will move through the level and have to find gems which are scattered around.
Each gem will award the player one point (subject to change)
The player will need to collect a certain amount of points before a timer runs out.
If they do they win, if they don't they lose.
The gems will be randomly placed around the level.
The level will also be procedurally generated
Powerups will also be available (e.g. to boost player speed or increase time etc.)

What will I need - I will need the following: > A variable to keep track of the players score and the time > A function to add to the players score when a gem is collected > A function to check if score or time is reached - this needs to be checked regularly > A function or method to generate the levels on the screen > Allow for key press inputs which control the character > The character will be a HTML element which will move while key is pressed - On mobile a key pad is needed as there is no keyboard > They will also need to inherit stats (e.g. move speed) from an object >Gems will also be HTMl elements that will be destroyed on collision - May be difficult
