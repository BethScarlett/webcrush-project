//////Game Project//////

Name - Webcrush
Type - Topdown exploration
Brief description - The player will move through the level and have to find gems which are scattered around.
Each gem will award the player one point (subject to change)
The player will need to collect a certain amount of points before a timer runs out.
If they do they win, if they don't they lose.
The gems will be randomly placed around the level.
The level will also be procedurally generated
Powerups will also be available (e.g. to boost player speed or increase time etc.)

What will I need - I will need the following: > A variable to keep track of the players score and the time > A function to add to the players score when a gem is collected > A function to check if score or time is reached - this needs to be checked regularly > A function or method to generate the levels on the screen > Allow for key press inputs which control the character > The character will be a HTML element which will move while key is pressed - On mobile a key pad is needed as there is no keyboard > They will also need to inherit stats (e.g. move speed) from an object >Gems will also be HTMl elements that will be destroyed on collision - May be difficult

/////To be completed/////

- The player needs to be able to move
  - They should only be able to move within a specific field
- Create a player object which will store their score and speed
- Wall blocks should spawn in the level on start
  - The player should be able to go outside of these
  - The blocks should spawn in a set way to start
    - This needs to be changed eventually to allow for random spawns
    - In this scenario the player should spawn after the walls, and only on a tile with no walls
- When the player runs into a gem the score needs to increment
  - The gem must also be destroyed (will attempt .innerhtml = "")
  - The score needs to be displayed on screen, and increment every time the above happens
- A timer needs to be kept, which will count down from x
  - The timer should count down correctly, and show on the screen
- When the timer is reached or the player collects enough gems/score the should end
  - Need a function that is running every x milliseconds/frame to keep checking the player score and time
  - From here if either condition is reached, an endgame function should run
    - This function should prevent further movement from the arrows and display a results screen
- The game needs to be able to start
  - Movement should be locked until something is pressed to start the game
  - The timer should not count down while game is not running
- Powerups should be scattered around which can be picked up
  - Similar to the gems, they should be destroyed on pickup
  - When they are collected they should increment either the players speed, or add time to the timer.

//Optional work if time alllows//

- Music should play while the game is running
  - The music should be toggleable
  - A different sound should play if the player wins or loses
- The walls should spawn randomly
  - The walls should choose a space to spawn before the player or gems

//////////////////Bug report//////////////////

Current Bugs:

Fixed Bugs:

Bug - Clicking on an arrow and moving mouse away before letting go will keep moving the player
Fix - Added mouse out event listener to each arrow which also runs the handlePlayerStop function
